    "Problem: Implement an algorithm to schedule drone-carried deliveries to customers in a small town. The town is organized in a perfect grid, with a warehouse and drone-launch facility at the center. All deliveries originate at the warehouse and are carried by a drone to a customer location. A drone's \"ground speed\" is exactly one horizontal or vertical grid block per minute. \n",
    "Your homework assignment is to design and write a drone launch scheduling program that maximizes the net promoter score (NPS) amongst drone-delivery customers. Net promoter score is defined as the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors. See the diagram below to understand the relationship between delivery speed and customer feedback responses. The town owns one drone, which is allowed to operate from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. Ground speed is the horizontal speed wind speed (WS), GroundSpeed-illustration.pngFlight parametersa wind direction (beta), a Flight Heading (alpha) and an Air Speed (AS).\n",
    "If its only ground speed Then distance travelled is 12.08 blocks Speed is 1 block/minute So time will be distance/speed so 12.08 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**NPS: the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors** \n",
    "**Time to delivery in Hours** \n",
    "**INPUT**: You will be given a file that contains one line of input for each order. That line includes an order identifier, followed by a space, the customer's grid coordinate, another space, and finally the order timestamp. The order identifier will have the format: WM####. The customer coordinate will have a North/South direction indicator (N or S) and a East/West indicator (E or W) -- for example: N5E10. The timestamp will have the format: HH:MM:SS. The orders in the input file will be sorted by order timestamp. See the Example Input File Rows section for an example of the input rows. \n",
    "**OUTPUT**: The program should produce a file that contains one output line for each customer order. That line should indicate the order number and the drone's departure time. The last line in the output file should contain the estimated NPS score. There is no requirement to deliver orders in sequence in which they were received.\n",
    "//A README file should be included in your submission that documents your assumptions and includes instructions for building the solution and executing the tests.\n",
    "Assumptions: The Battery of the drone works throughout Drone returns to the center of the grid No weight of delivery taken into consideration Euclidean distance is calculated Manhattan distance\n",
    "Test Cases: Two deliveries which the same time starting at 5, having the same NPS, the first one would be started first, the second one will start at the same time too. We don't have two drones.\n",
    "Long distances: Might never be scheduled. Large number of short duration orders\n",
